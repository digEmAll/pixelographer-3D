# pixelographer-3D

A browser-only (no backend) web application to turn images into pixelized 3D models, that can be printed in multicolor using an FDM.

# How it works

The web application allows you to upload an image, scale it and reduce its colors to a certain customizable palette (using dithering algorithms); than each pixel will be drawn at different height according to the colors and turned into a downloadable 3D model (in STL format).
With a 3D FDM printer you can slice the model, set the manual/automatic color changes in the slicer and that's it!

# Usage

This web-application is browser-only (there is no backend, the uploaded images are stored temporarily on your browser) and directly hosted on github page: https://digemall.github.io/pixelographer-3D/

## Instructions

- Upload an image
- Play with scale and dithering settings
- Play with 3D model settings and download the STL
